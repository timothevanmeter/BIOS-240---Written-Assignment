<h2>Options</h2>
  
For each written assignment you are to choose one of the opotions listed below, read the publication associated and answer the corresponding questions in your essay.

<h4>Option 1</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>In a one-page, single-spaced essay, explain how nectar feeding birds respond to more concentrated sugars are present in their food.   In terms of the energy budgets of these animals, why might this be a surprise?  To what conclusions do the authors come about this?  Do you agree that this is likely?  In terms of physiology and evolution, why would plants provide birds with the amount of nectar that they actually provide?</li>
    <li><a href="Nectar_Feeding_Birds.pdf">Nectar Feeding Birds Paper</a></li>
  </ul>
  
<h4>Option 2</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>In a one-page single spaced essay, detail the methods the authors used to investigate the thermal biology of these bees, and their conclusions.  In terms of adaptation to their environment, do these results make sense to you?  Explain.  Cite sources to support your arguments.</li>
    <li><a href="Stingless_Bees.pdf">Stingless Bees Paper</a></li>
  </ul> 
  
<h4>Option 3</h4>  
   <ul>
     <li>In terms of the physiology of thermoregulation, discuss the paper and its conclusions.  Given that mammals are endothermic homeotherms, how will climate change impact their ability to thermoregulate?</li>
    <li><a href="Climate_Change.pdf">Climate Change Paper</a></li>
  </ul> 
  
<h4>Option 4</h4>
 <ul>
    <li>In terms of energy budgets, discuss the upriver migration of sockeye salmon.  Explain some of the methods the researchers used, and their conclusions.  Finally, this paper is from the 1970â€™s-what is the value of reading a very old paper like this?</li>
    <li><a href="Salmon_Energetics.pdf">Salmon Energetics Paper</a></li>
  </ul>
