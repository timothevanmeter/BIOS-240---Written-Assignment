<h2 id="Format">Format</h2>
  
For each written assignment you are to choose one of the options listed below, read the publication associated and answer the corresponding questions in <b>a one-page, single-spaced essay: see the <a href="TEMPLATE__BIOS_240.pdf">template.</a></b> Having the title, the body of the essay and the references on seperate pages helps you to see if your assignment is respecting the format requirements.

There is only four options available for the written assignement, listed below.
 
 <h2  id="Options">Options</h2>
 
<h4>Option 1</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Describe, as briefly as possible, the methodology of measuring field metabolic rates.  What did the authors learn about the bioenergetics of leatherback turtles from this study?  Was a hypothesis being tested?  Is there a value to a study with no hypothesis test?</li>
    <li><a href="Turtle_Paper.pdf">Turtle Paper</a></li>
  </ul>
  
<h4>Option 2</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Describe the methods of this paper and its conclusions.  Does this paper support the notion that a transition to semalparous behavior is adaptive?  What could possibly be an advantage to dying during the act of reproduction?</li>
    <li><a href="Fish_Paper.pdf">Fish Paper</a></li>
  </ul> 
  
<h4>Option 3</h4>  
   <ul>
     <li>Explain the purpose of this paper and its methodology.  How are lizard body sizes distributed taxonomically?  Do island lizards really have larger body sizes?  What can we tell about evolution from a paper like this and what are the limitations of this kind of methodology?</li>
    <li><a href="Lizard_Paper.pdf">Lizard Paper</a></li>
  </ul> 
  
<h4>Option 4</h4>
 <ul>
    <li>Describe how bats thermoregulate and how they use behavior to minimize the energetic demands of being a small mammal.</li>
    <li><a href="Bat_Paper.pdf">Bat Paper</a></li>
  </ul>

  
  
<h2 id="Guidelines">Guidelines for the written assignment</h2>
<p>Each assignment is worth 20 points for a very short paper, so we expect the paper to be concise and well written. Your writing skill is not a criterion for grading in and of itself, but it is much easier to get your point across if you structure your sentences well.</p>

<h3>Citations</h3>
<p>We expect several, reliable references, cited using in-text citations (<a href="http://apaformat.org/apa-pdf-citation/">How to use in-text citations</a>).  The exact number is up to you, but Wikipedia, though not forbidden, is not a stellar reference. At least four references, possibly many more, make for good research. Please, do not cite online study forums. Please, if you use any text from another source, cite it.</p>


<p>For each assignment, we expect you to respond to the paper in a particular way. Coherent, interesting, and well thought-out responses that reveal an understanding of the paper will receive higher grades. You must make it clear that you understand the paper, its methods, and its conclusions.</p>


<p><b>The assignment must be on time and no portion may be identical to something submitted by another student.</b></p>


  
<h2 id="Grading">Grading Policy for the written assignment</h2>
  
  <p>The following points will be evaluated in the written assignments:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding the question asked</b>: Are you really answering the question asked in the instructions. Is all your essay directed towards this problem or are parts of it unnecessary.</li>
    <li><b>Reading thoroughly the publication</b>: Did you find all of the arguments related to the question in the publication, did you understand them. Of course, for this references to the original text are required.</li>
    <li><b>Researching and thinking about the question</b>: Did you find additional arguments to answer the question, do you have criticism towards some of the hypothesis in the literature, do you have a hypothesis of your own concerning the question.</li>
    <li><b>Summarizing your reflexion with a conclusion</b> focusing on the main arguments as well as the additional questions raised by the initial problematic.</li>
  </ul>
