<h2>Options</h2>
  
For each written assignment you are to choose one of the options listed below, read the publication associated and answer the corresponding questions in your essay.

<h4>Option 1</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>In a one-page, single-spaced essay, explain how nectar feeding birds respond to more concentrated sugars are present in their food.   In terms of the energy budgets of these animals, why might this be a surprise?  To what conclusions do the authors come about this?  Do you agree that this is likely?  In terms of physiology and evolution, why would plants provide birds with the amount of nectar that they actually provide?</li>
    <li><a href="Nectar_Feeding_Birds.pdf">Nectar Feeding Birds Paper</a></li>
  </ul>
  
<h4>Option 2</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>In a one-page single spaced essay, detail the methods the authors used to investigate the thermal biology of these bees, and their conclusions.  In terms of adaptation to their environment, do these results make sense to you?  Explain.  Cite sources to support your arguments.</li>
    <li><a href="Stingless_Bees.pdf">Stingless Bees Paper</a></li>
  </ul> 
  
<h4>Option 3</h4>  
   <ul>
     <li>In terms of the physiology of thermoregulation, discuss the paper and its conclusions.  Given that mammals are endothermic homeotherms, how will climate change impact their ability to thermoregulate?</li>
    <li><a href="Climate_Change.pdf">Climate Change Paper</a></li>
  </ul> 
  
<h4>Option 4</h4>
 <ul>
    <li>In terms of energy budgets, discuss the upriver migration of sockeye salmon.  Explain some of the methods the researchers used, and their conclusions.  Finally, this paper is from the 1970â€™s-what is the value of reading a very old paper like this?</li>
    <li><a href="Salmon_Energetics.pdf">Salmon Energetics Paper</a></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Guidelines for the written assignment</h2>
<p>They are worth 20 points-for a very short paper, so we expect the paper to be concise and well-written. Your writing skill is not a criterion for grading in and of itself-but it is much easier to get your point across if you structure your sentences well.</p>

<p>We expect several, reliable references, cited using in-text citations.  The exact number is up to you, but Wikipedia, though not forbidden, is not a stellar reference.  At least four references, possibly many more, make for good research.  Please do not cite online study forums.  Please, if you use any text from another source-cite it.</p>

<p>For each assignment, we expect you to respond to the paper in a particular way.  Coherent, interesting, and well thought-out responses that reveal an understanding of the paper receive higher grades.  You must make it clear that understand the paper, its methods, and its conclusions.</p>

<p>The paper must be on time and no portion may be identical to something submitted by another student.</p>
